  <p>How I like my coffee?</p>
  <p>I'm not completely 100% sure how I like my coffee. I think I keep changing how I like making it since I work at a bakery I try to make different types of coffee to see which one I like. So far I think an iced cafe mocha with whip cream on top has been my go-to since before I started working there but It hasn't changed</p>
